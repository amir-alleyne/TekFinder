## Introduction

Football scouting is rapidly evolving with the rise of data analytics and machine learning. **TekFinder** is designed to help football clubs, scouts, and analysts make data-driven decisions. By employing the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm, TekFinder groups and classifies players based on similar performance metrics and playing styles, potentially uncovering hidden talent in vast datasets.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Integration:**  
  Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to cluster players, helping you identify and compare talents based on their on-field performance and statistics.

- **Robust Data Management:**  
  Stores all player data and historical records in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS. This setup provides scalability, reliability, and secure data storage.

- **API Deployment:**  
  The RESTful API is deployed on On-Render, ensuring fast and reliable access to TekFinder’s services from any client application or dashboard.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  An integrated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline automates testing and deployment, ensuring a robust and error-free code base at every stage of development.

## Architecture Overview

TekFinder is built with a modular design that ensures each component can scale and evolve independently:

1. **Machine Learning Module:**  
   - **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for clustering and classification.
   - **Data Processing:** Involves normalization, feature extraction, and transformation to prepare data for analysis.

2. **Database Layer:**  
   - **PostgreSQL on AWS:** A high-performance, scalable database solution that securely stores player statistics and historical data.

3. **API Layer:**  
   - **RESTful API:** Deployed on On-Render, this layer handles client requests, data retrieval, and exposes endpoints for querying and analyzing player information.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
   - **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and static code analysis ensure that every change is validated.
   - **Continuous Deployment:** Successful builds are automatically deployed, keeping the production environment up-to-date.
